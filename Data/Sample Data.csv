22,"So I am a week into taking Wellbutrin. About day 5 I had a few hours where I literally FELT things. Happiness, my surroundings, everything felt magical. And then the next day I am just irritable and anxious. The first two days were pretty awesome as well minus the odd dreams. And I notice I sleep longer than normal on wellbutrin as well so far. But yeah. Right now I am anxious. Depression is kind of worse. Abd I have the odd feeling in my right abdomen. does not hurt to touch but I can feel it flare up occasionally. Not painful. But definitely worried it is messing up my liver or something dangerous. Anyhow. I have been dealing with a pretty gnarly depression since having covid last year and I was hoping that this would help since SSRIs do not agree with me. Also, I have not noticed any improvement in libido. In fact, sometimes cannot even sustain an erection while taking this. Although I did wake up with a surprisingly good one last night Anyhow, just seeing if anyone had any advice or similar experiences. Feeling pretty down right now :( Wellbutrin side effects",Depression
23,"Hi, I know that probably nobody is interested in listening to this, but I am trying anyways because I have nothing to lose already.I am stuck on a life that seems to not get any better.I lost one of my best friends because of a bad decision that cannot be retracted, I am stuck on a job which I do not see myself getting out of. And worst of all, I feel that everyday I am losing who I am, and I just need to get this pain out, just feel a bit of enjoy on my life. I am tired of fighting for what I think is right: caring for other, looking for friends, searching for the good for everyone (even me). This has only brought on me pain and dread, I cannot be the person that I wanted to be and that makes me empty. I do not feel to be a bad person, I cannot ignore other people's emotions, and if I am made fun of it, I am being called fucking stupid for it, for everyone I know, maybe its that I am not made to be in this world.

I do not know how severe my depression is but what I do know is that it keeps getting worse. I lack interest in everything I do and most of the stuff I want to do I put them off and get bumed when I do not do it. I have thought of suicide in my teen years, I tried to act on it once but did not go through it, right now this thought is way more present each day. I feel that one day when I am alone and depressed I might act on it, I am just tired of this feeling that nothing is worth it, that I am wasting my life just being sad. I am going to therapy, have 6 months in therapy now but I feel nothing is working, I have tried to be more positive, I just feel so damn alone and that the only way to stop this feeling is finishing my life.

26,"i have no other options but to go on anti depressants. I have been suffering with chronic depression since I was 12. I am 22 in September. I have gone through sexual assault and developed PTSD bc of it. I also have a severe ridiculous anxiety disorder plus a history with anorexia and other eating disorders. Through all this time I have tried everything to pull myself out of the shithole, I went through a period of time where I was addicted to hard exercise, I spend a lot of time pouring time into my career which is my life long passion, have been going tk therapy for a year and a half. last year things got so bad for me and I felt so deeply alone that I got myself a puppy. Right now she is the ONLY reason I go outside and get 10 thousand steps daily. I really was hoping that my pup could make me feel less lonely, but she is actually quite detached. In her 7 months of life I have never been able to cuddle with her - she does not like it, and I am not going to force her. She tends to gravitate to my mother much more despite the fact that I am the person who feeds her, walks her, trains her and generally takes care of her hygiene. I have realized recently that this might be because I am filled with nothing but negative, putrid energy, which makes sense how a young pup might not want to be around me. I still love her deeply but yet again I have reached another disappointment where I just keep being a problem.The only reason I refuse to go on medication is because I do not want to gain weight as a result, I know not all medicines do this, but most will do it.

But I feel like everything is paper, flimsy and like I am about to fall over or fly away. Everything is draining even the idea of sleeping is too much for my body to handle, which is weird because I thought depressed people loved to sleep, but somehow sleeping just makes things worse. I feel stuck in this bubble where I do not feel anything. Its worse than a fog. I can see things around me but I do not feel like I am apart of them. I also have totally separated myself from everyone socially. I never was one to have many friends, but I have recently deleted and removed all of my accounts and friends from said accounts.

43,"Tardive Dyskinesia, medication adjustments and the manic aftermath. Hi everyone, 

Itâ€™s hard to know where to start. I started medication for bipolar as an adolescent (13 I think) but I have been bipolar since I was a young child, and it feels like there is nothing before it. I am entering my late twenties now (so still young) but as you may know even in my childhood there was a lot of controversy about whether children could be bipolar and very little known about medicating children for being bipolar. I did have a child psychiatrist and I sincerely believe he did the best he could for me. That being said, everything was sort of a stab in the dark. I am sure there are many of you who can relate. 

It turns out that a good psychiatrist is hard to find around here, so the next one I went to missed a medication interaction between a non psychiatric medication I was already on and lamictal. He also happened to miss my signs of tardive dyskinesia even though I brought them to his attention several times. I no longer see him. I am no longer on lamictal. 

I now see a new psychiatrist and she is fantastic. I am in good hands and trust that, but she had to bring me down from a fairly standard dose of Abilify I have been on for the past 14 years to basically almost nothing because of the tardive dyskinesia. I was fine at first, surprisingly fine and stable, but now I have been manic/hypomanic for a couple of weeks when I was pretty well managed before. 

I see my psychiatrist in three days. I plan to talk to her and come up with a plan to deal with this at that appointment. 

Itâ€™s just at my last appointment, before the mania started, we talked about my choices and my medication options are now limited based on what did not work for me before and especially now thanks to developing TD and I am just scared. There may be some major changes to my medication. 

I have started this amazing life with this amazing girl. I have a stable job. We are getting married next year. We have a home. We have cats. We have a future. We want kids. I am scared because although she has seen me in bad moments and knows of my past, she has not truly experienced me at my worst. I know she will always love me but I am terrified- terrified of the td getting worse. Terrified of feeling out of control again. 

I donâ€™t really know what I expect from any comments. I suppose I just needed to say this to people who would understand how I feel. Most people I know and talk to donâ€™t get it at all. They have not lived it. I needed to confide in people who struggle with what I struggle with. 

Itâ€™s like my life that I worked so hard to build and maintain since I was a child (with consistent therapy, with medication, and with A LOT of everyday effort) is going to be ripped out from under me and itâ€™s not even my doing. I did everything right. It hurts. Itâ€™s scary. Itâ€™s a lot. 

Sorry this is so long. I hope there are still people willing to read it.

44,"Symptoms for bipolar disorder? Hello all,
I'm 18 years old and I'm new to Reddit. When I was ten years old, I began to have depression. It wasn't severe, but I would often isolate myself from others and think about dying. Over time, my depression has gotten worse. However, at age 12 I began to have severe mood swings. Sometimes I would get very angry at everybody and everything around me for no reason. Sometimes it would last for a few days, and then I would go back to feeling ""stable"" or depressed. At age 15, I began to have three distinct and intense emotions that have taken over my life until this point. I rarely felt stable at that point. This feeling can occur for a week or less, I feel veryyyyyyy euphoric. I actually love life and everything around me. I feel very energetic and hyper like a five year old. I'm bouncing off the walls, and talk very fast because my thoughts race. Sometimes I can't sleep at night because my thoughts would never shut up. However, I have never done anything impulsive. I'm mostly abnormally energetic and euphoric. Then, I can switch to a depressive episode. These are always the longest, they can last for 4-6 months. At that moment, I'm extremely suicidal. I've never tried to commit suicide because I'm scared of failing but the craving is always there. I'm also hopeless, think that everybody hates me, and I feel so dead and emotionally tired. I sleep for 8-9 hours and I still feel tired. I can have a good day and still feel extremely miserable even though I know I shouldn't. Then, after my depressive episode, I can feel super angry and annoyed at everything and everybody for no reason. I just get super angry and lash out at anybody, and I don't know why. This lasts for a week or less. I have been to 4 therapists and none of them have really helped; I can't really afford one right now. My family aren't very supportive, it's taboo to talk about mental illness so they ignore my symptoms or brush them off as hormones since I'm a female. Could I be bipolar? Is it just hormones? your insight would be nice, I hope to a doctor soon to get a proper diagnosis but your insight will be helpful.

45,"Loss and depression go really well together I was doing well, on new medication, ping ponging a bit but never getting fully manic or fully depressed. Now, I knew I would be depressed for about two weeks after the end of the semester. The change in schedule always does it. But, during the second half of the semester, a good friend passed away. Afterwards, a good mutual friend started acting very strange, sometimes flat out mean. Our relationship was strained for about a month for reasons I don't fully know. He eventually blocked me online even though we had agreed that no matter what we would say goodbye as he was graduating. I was easily able to push it all away when I needed to during the semester. Now I just keep falling deeper and deeper as opposed to the normal brief depression. I can't think of my friend that passed without thinking of the one that blocked me and vice versa. They were my two go tos, the people I talked to every day and who made me feel secure. My world was turned upside down. Two of the very few people I would go to are gone. I don't know how to pull myself out this time and, honestly, I'm scared.",Bipolar
46,"Struggling to stay medicated (xpost from r/bipolar2) I was diagnosed a few years ago (bp2) after a long depressive stage and short hypomania. Basically I have a hard time staying medicated. I recognize that it helps make the depressive and hypomanic stages more manageable and my life more livable in some ways. However, there are a few things counteracting this:

1. I sometimes get this intense urge to cut/hurt myself. It's so intense that I can't focus on anything else, and it makes me very irritable and frustrated. All I can think about is ripping my veins open, I want it more than anything. Theyve tossed around the idea that it could be harm OCD ,but no therapy (ERP) works on it. No idea if it's that or just another facet of bipolar, but it seems to get more intense and unbearable when I'm slightly affected by but not consumed by depression. This plays into wanting to stop medicating because it gets so intense that I'd almost rather be severely depressed. It's like I can't win.

2. In a sick way, I like feeling extreme emotions. I really can't describe it. I don't enjoy being severely depressed or even hypomanic, and yet I want it. Even the depression.

3. I think I deserve it. I'm not sad about deserving it either. Rather, I'm angry about it. Angry about not feeling extreme emotions and instead feeling dead all the time, even though I'm still experiencing rapid cycling with only sometimes less intensity.

Just. I'm fucking mad. All the time. I want to flay my veins and feel all the feelings. And yet I'm sick of it all 

Just, can anyone relate? I don't know how to fix this, or if I even want to feel okay anymore. I'm waiting for a new therapist in February and I'm not hopeful that it will help. Waiting for psychiatrists appt at the end of January, and I dont even know what to say. I'm fucking sick of trying meds and trying to justify side effects...nausea, rashes, 60 pounds gained, lack of focus, constant exhaustion, poor memory. And I'm irritable because of wanting to flay my veins.

It took me a bit to fully pull out of it.

49,"Restricting stressors on devices. help! Hi all, I thought this would be a good place to ask.

Sometimes its best for my stress and anxiety to flat out block apps and websites that cause me stress. I have a very bad habit of wanting to dig things up from the past, even if they would hurt me, and often times the best way for me to combat this is to restrict myself from accessing social media.

Right now I've been using an app called 'Freedom' which has been very useful. The issue? I've figured out how to disable it whenever I want. Knowing that at any point I could breach the restrictions I put in place just makes me super anxious. I'm able to go into the VPN settings and turn off 'connect on demand' which allows me to bypass the block.

Does anyone know any surefire way I can block things, and not have access to them? being able to set a block on social media for 24 hours is often the best way I can get back on track with my day, and stop stressing over digging up things that would hurt me.

50,"My mind &amp; body choses flight instead of fight.  I (26F), am going through it tonight. Honestly? I couldn't tell if my post belonged in the anxiety or rant subreddit, but I asked myself aloud, ""How do I feel?"", and my answer was: stressed.

So, here I am. 

Crying and bawling my eyes out. 'Why?' you might ask. Well, I'll tell you a little bit about me...I am an overweight female who has gone through shit in my 26 years of living. My childhood was basically robbed of me, mainly because I witnessed fights and screaming matches between family members and a near divorce with the parentals. I was also bullied majority of my early childhood all the way through middle school. After all of this happened (and there was a lot more than that), I felt like I was forced to grow up and basically chose 'flight mode' to save myself.

What I mean by that is, closing myself off. Staying in my room and coming out when I absolutely have to. I have a fear of being rejected, and being a failure. I am afraid of being yelled at for doing something wrong and I have a fear of getting into trouble and being reprimanded.

I still live with my parents and I have no job because of just basically, being socially anxious. I stutter around people I don't know and that makes me even more anxious and self-conscious. I forget things easily and that in turn, furthers my fear of being incapable of a job. On top of that, I have trouble sleeping at night because thoughts run through my head a million times a second. Because of this, I wake up late almost everyday (at 11am).

Just tonight, my mom basically dumped a, 'we need to talk' case on me and already I felt my blood run cold. She's talking to me but all I hear is my heart thumping in my ears. She tells me I need to work on waking up early because the rest of the world wakes up early like ""adults"". I felt very offended by that and told her that it's not my fault that I can't sleep properly at night. I, in fact, tell this to her everyday, so it's not old news. Yet, when I did remind her of this, she basically sighed and almost wanted to roll her eyes. Then she tells me I need a week to just 'work on myself' to fix that and realistically, thats not how that works but I didn't say anything.

Then she tells me I need to find a job. Something that pays and that 70% of the world gets up and does a 9 to 5 job which I already knew. Now, I was starting think she thinks I'm lazy or something when it's absolutely not the case.

Truth is, I have been getting together with my younger sister who is an artist on doing freelance stuff that we are both interested in doing. We have been talking about it little by little. I told my mom this and she didn't seem to believe me, basically looking at me with an expression of, ""Ohhh really like what"".

So she asks, ""Okay, what have y'all worked on today?"" of all things she asks on the day me and my younger sister decide to take at least the day off from planning. I said, ""Well, we are taking a break today but I designed some stuff for xx and sended it to her and she reformatted and polished it up."" my mom seemed to deflate in a way that said, 'That was it?' 

Not gonna lie, it made me feel bad and then she went into a repeated 5 minute lecture on how we need to wake up earlier and start the day like adults. Meanwhile I'm here depressed, stressed and just over it at this point. Over the fact that she just doesn't understand at all. She says, 'I know you can do it. I know that.'

But does she really? Anytime I do, 'do it', she seemes to be unsatisfied and that pushes me a million steps back. 

I get upset and after we finish talking, I go to my room to sleep (11pm at this point) and I just start bawling at how useless I felt and the whole, 'why is my life like this'.

It took so much in me not to burst into tears in front of her but man my throat was tighrening so bad it hurt that I couldn't speak for a good few seconds.

I don't know, I guess I just need some advice on the situation? Anytime I'm in this position my stress literally goes through the roof and I don't know how to manage it (like the need to runaway, disappear or worse). I really do want to work, I want to recieve a paycheck and get my own place and my own car and things, but why am I always on flight mode all the time?",Stress

His belief is, what's the point of saving if we all die! Funnily enough, before the pandemic, he was a cheapskate always saving and thinking long-term. Interesting to see him have changed this much.

A part of me agrees, and of course, disagrees. For me, I have started to find different things important that weren't so before, going out for dinner with friends, and prioritising experiences over materialistic goods. Crazy to think that 2 years went by in our lives that we'll never get back and how it changed our lives and will most likely impact how we think about how we spend our money and manage it forever in the future.

-2k in credit card debt due to stupid fucking bullshit coming out of nowhere and having to shell out money for it

-used up most of my TFSA because of stupid fucking covid hitting literally the same month of buying my first ever home and losing my good paying job due to the company using covid as a scapegoat and ""selling the company"" when in reality, the assholes fired all but 8 people and kept operations open

A few months ago my kid was diagnosed with cancer. We set up a 504 to reduce the amount of assignments and give them extended time.

They were then out of school for two weeks for surgery. All of their teachers except the problem teacher followed the 504 and greatly reduced the amount of their makeup assignments.

Regardless, my kid worked hard to turn in a large portion of the assignments. Yet, they're still failing that class.

I emailed the teacher today to make sure she graded all the assignments. She told me she did, but otherwise did not give me any helpful information in getting my child's grade up. I then asked if she has been following the 504 plan and I've not received a response.

I've already been second guessing whether I was too aggressive in my emails, but at the same time I feel like I'm going to have to escalate it with the school.

I'm stressed and I've been fucking sick to my stomach all day. I'm cycling between anger and embarrassment and I'm going nuts.

Just needed to vent ðŸ˜ž

Edited: Thank you everyone for your encouragement. I've been in continued correspondence with the teacher. She stated that she has already reduced the amount of work, but I still have issue with the amount and content.

I also elaborated on the fact that my child has been having issues all year only in this class. My child has told me they're afraid of this teacher and they struggle with her teaching methods. The teacher had no helpful comments, and has only repeated that ""the issue is missing assignments"" as if I don't have eyes. She also said she thinks they can turn this semester around if ""we"" can motivate them, and thinks they are not having academic difficulties. This rubs me the wrong way because motivation starts in the classroom and she's clearly been lacking.

Does anyone else struggle opening up to friends/partner? I mean obviously we all have avpd so yes, but do you guys have strategies?",Personality disorder
97,"I want to do a job that requires social skills I do not have great social skills. I am awkward and shy. 

But I saw an ad for a job that helps adults with disabilities find and maintain employment. I want to apply for it but it requires making connections with business owners and having good interpersonal skills. 

This is just a vent about wanting things that are outside the realm of being a good idea...",Personality disorder
98,"DAE just not imagine themselves being around after a certain age? In my head I never think I'm going to make X years of age (30 for example) and it's not because I specifically plan to do anything but I just kind of think ""I'll probably be far too fed up of this misery at that point and end it""

...and then that milestone age will come and it'll then change to the next one that I can't imagine making it past.",Personality disorder

100,"Where do AvPD people hang out irl I know you donâ€™t go out often, but when you do, where are you? 

What clubs/interest groups has the highest chance of having avpd people? Iâ€™m trying to find my own kind. Looking for people like yourself, thatâ€™s pretty normal right?",Personality disorder
101,"Is this really it Have you ever looked up and realized that months have passed without you even noticing. And everything is moving around you, time, people, events, but youâ€™re just standing there staring at it. And you realize just how much youâ€™ve lost in this static state. And now itâ€™s just gone and itâ€™s too late and you have to keep going. Time changes nothing and it waits for no one. And leaving all these things up to time and opportunity was just another way to avoid being held accountable for my lack of action. And now Iâ€™m here and now I have to deal with it. And thatâ€™s all itâ€™ll ever be. I hate that I control my life. I donâ€™t want to. I just want to leave. Or stop. I just want everything to slow down. Thereâ€™s so much I want to achieve and yet Iâ€™m just standing here staring at everyone else. I want these things so badly I donâ€™t understand why I canâ€™t just do them it hurts. So much time has passed that Iâ€™m scared this is all Iâ€™ll ever be.",Personality disorder
102,"AvPD or something else? Sorry if this is actually completely normal or off-topic. Basically I find myself so genuinely hideous, in a ""You look too ridiculous to seriously expect anyone to acknowledge you as a fellow human being"" kind of way. It doesn't just stop at my appearance, either. It's literally every single facet of my being that is too ridiculous to ever be taken seriously. It prevents me from talking to people, finding a well paying job, making friends of any kind, doing literally anything out of the ordinary (including necessary appointments like the doctor) or even wanting to be alive. The only person I see regularly now outside of work is my therapist who insists there isn't anything wrong with me as a person but I find it incredibly hard to believe he doesn't see just how unbelievably embarrassing and stupid I am. This feeling causes me constant distress and is completely unshakeable even though I am aware of how ""logically"" silly it is and I worry it might mean I have a personality disorder because it handicaps every part of my life. Obviously no one on here can diagnose me but I guess I am wondering if it sounds similar to what you guys deal with.",Personality disorder
103,"Root of avpd and life-damaging thoughts I had M21. My problem with avpd is that it made me weak, defenseless, I feel like prey living among predators.
My self esteem is low and I know how it can be increased, it ""just"" requires me to be strong and all the problems will eventually disappear.

I was bullied by two different group of people, I realize now the reason was that they instantly saw my weakness, the second time I was bullied by my friends (at that time), initially they even respected me cause I was serious, but when you can't defend yourself it looks pathetic and I even can see their perspective, you just need to be more tough and confident (without any reason).

This experience reflected in my thoughts I was living with till recently:
when I was a kid I thought you need to really know how to dance, know the technique or some kind of particular style but thinking about my stupid rural relatives refuted it, cause how they being so stupid could think about it really, it's not possible, but they fuck, I don't.

second was about clothes, hypebeasts.
I thought classmates were making fun of me cause I looked weird, lame. Even though it's not fully wrong I just exaggerated it on a new extreme level. There wasn't particularly anything wrong with my clothes, I just couldn't understand their reaction.

Third was about thinking that the group of people knew something that I missed, or like there was some hidden context I was unaware of. It was a constant thought when I was with my peers.

I also has such problem that I often can't decide when I should feel offended and when not, it's important cause it can really lead to being a punching bag. This is also a beginning of my PPD part of personality. This kind of thinking leads to paranoia.

I hope I won't regret posting this. Maybe it's the only time I can be honest.",Personality disorder
104,"How to not play the role of a therapist in a friendship? I've been thinking recently that most of my friendships have a pattern. It's always the other person sharing things about their life and me listening to them or consoling them or whatever.

I don't know if the friends I've had have been bad listeners, but it feels like whenever I try to share something about myself with people it kind of dies down and gets lost in time.

How do I not play the role of a therapist in the relationships I form? I'm getting tired of this but also I don't know how to convey it to other people in a way that won't result in permanent damage.",Personality disorder

106,"I am a 17, nearly 18 year old trans girl. I have not come out to anybody I know irl or started transitioning or anything. I love my girlfriend so much and we have been dating for almost 3 years. in april of 2020 i realized that I am trans and that there is no way i can keep living as a boy. every cell in my body wishes I would have told her I was questioning my gender when I first started to like 2 years ago. once i was sure i was trans, i thought id tell her I was questioning and come out to her as non binary to test the waters because I was too scared to officially come out. she started crying and said she was scared of a lot of stuff that I do not exactly remember. I feel so so so stuck. to make it worse, my sister is also trans, and has come out publicly. she moved out before coming out and my parents constantly deadname and misgender her, including to her face. my parents are paying for me to go to college but I do not know if they would keep paying for that if I came out. i want my girlfriend and I to live the rest of our lives with each other but she has BPD and I am her FP. if coming out to her does not go well, she will probably kill herself, which would make me kill myself, which might make my sister kill herself. i have no idea how much longer i can live as a boy but i do not know when I would come out much less if I ever can. it feels liket here is no way for things to go well and for me to live. please, i just want to be heard. it feels like there is no way my life can go on. i do not want to kill the love of my life",Suicidal

109,"I have never actually been actively suicidal, but the thought has been there ever since my early teens when something pretty traumatic happened to me. It was sort of a back door, you know? But never something I considered going through with in a near future. I did not have a plan or anything really, but the thought of having a way out was comfort enough. Really, the simple thought that ""this will not last forever, it will all end some day"" was usually enough to keep me from feeling panicked and claustrophobic for simply being alive. And growing up I navely thought that life would just automatically get better without me actually putting in the time and effort to make it so. The prospect of becoming an unemployed, depressed and washed up adult did not even occur to me. I was convinced that by this time I would either be dead or having gotten my shit together, have a decent job and maybe even a steady relationship. This in-between sad existence was something I did not expect. 13 year old me would be so disappointed. Now I am at a stage in life where I am still young, but I have managed to ruin basically everything I had going for me in life. If I had put in the effort I could have gone places. But here I am, borderline-alcoholic, depressed, used up and hating myself. Through my careless, self destructive lifestyle I have gotten myself a bad reputation, allowed people to take advantage of me and used and abused other people and more or less hurt myself in every way possible, physically and mentally. I am scarred and damaged inside and out. I am a she will. I have gone out of my way to make sure I get to see the very worst of human kind by spending my time with others who hate themselves and life as much as I do. I have destroyed so much I do not even know if I have more to lose. I feel like a bottomless hole of hatred, rage and contempt for myself and everyone else. I cannot feel happiness, I cannot love. I cannot feel anything but shame, regret and anger. I resent myself for allowing life to get this bad. I am not considering suicide now, but part of me wishes that teenage me would have just ended things before this shitshow began, so I would not have to live down this long walk of shame. I thought there would be some kind of reward or feeling of pride at this point for fighting to stay alive. But all I get is more and more shit thrown at me. It never ends. Life just deteriorates and I feel like a zombie. I wish I had killed myself when I was a teenager",Suicidal

111,"I imagine death will probably just be like a dreamless sleep. I am truly looking forward to it. will not feel any pain, feel any anxiety, have any bad thoughts, I just will not be here. Sure, I will not get to experience happiness either. But I will not be here to think about that. Ill just be dead. If I did not think about how badly my family would be affected by it I would have done it by now no question. I do not doubt it will happen soon. I hope they understand.

112,"Recently I started a good job at on the marketing of a big financial company in my country, I am 25 and I have 2 MBAs, I should feel good at a job like this, right? But I do not. I have started 3 months ago, and after 2 years of being mentally fine, now my anxiety is trough the roof, my depression is apparently back with super strength, and I cried 3 times today, I have been imagining death for some time now. I am not actively considering killing myself because I have lost 2 important people to suicide and I do not want others to suffer for my pain, they do not disserve this. As long as I can, I will hold on.. But I really keep thinking like ""maybe today something will happen and this nonstop pain will end.""Worst of all, even tho I know this job is triggering this, I cannot leave, because I really need this money to pay my studies and to live. My best friend and ex-gf is the only person who I usually talked about this Crysis, but recently she had her own Crysis and I cannot tell her about it because I cannot put her mental health in danger.I just feel like a little part of me dies every fucking minute and I need it to stop.

I was supposed to get the money, my mum gets as child support because I move out and literally do not need to come home and use anything there. it is over 200 bucks, that would have helped a lot. She told me ""I will give you some when you really need it""I will not be able to afford therapy anymore I do not know what I will do, if something breaks or I need something else besides food I thought this was my step towards independence but now I need to beg for money from my mum, while I have to be scared because I will not be able to save up for emergencies. I am crying so much because I do not know what to do now. I worked my ass off, just to get to this point and now this is what I get. I cannot even go and work to get more money because then the government will not pay me money for school and rent anymore.I worked through my worst depressive episode, massive anxiety and so much stress but now I wish I could press a button to disappear.
